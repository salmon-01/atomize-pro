Atomize Pro is a productivity app that aims to enhance the overall experience of goal-tracking and progress management for all spheres of life. Keep track of both short-term and long-term goals, and measure progress in a variety of ways, not just standard box-ticking.

##### Create different types of goals:

1) A check-list for simplicity and black-and-white outcomes
2) A progress bar for meeting a specific number of units
3) Sets for tracking repetitions of activities
4) A three-level block for measuring progress in stages.

##### Other features:

- Keep your goals organized in lists and stored under customized tabs for easy navigation and overwhelm prevention.
- Track overall progress of all goals using the global progress bar
- Pick a theme for your spaces
